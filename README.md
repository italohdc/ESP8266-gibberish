### Errors found

* ~~For some reason, when using Serial Monitor on Arduino IDE, the information sent through ``Serial.print("Lorem Ipsum")`` only start printing after some write was made (not sure yet if after any x characters or after x ``\n`` characters).~~
* Uploading firmware works better when using 1M Flash. (And also solves the above problem) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
